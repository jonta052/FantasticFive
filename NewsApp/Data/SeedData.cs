                            Content = "Despite all of the headlines about hacks and data breaches that show up far too frequently in our news feeds, even the most basic of security guidelines are regularly disregarded. When people use simplistic, easy to guess passwords to secure their accounts, for example, it makes the work of bad actors much easier. A recent report by Forbes revealed that 59% of Americans use a person’s name or birthday in their password. And these bad passwords are reused an average of 14 times for various different accounts. But if you use a more complex, unguessable password, then you are safe, right?\r\n\r\nNot exactly. Better passwords will certainly help to keep your accounts more secure, but cyber crooks always seem to be one step ahead of the current best security practices. One of the latest tools to emerge in the toolkits of unscrupulous hackers is called a thermal attack. With the cost of capable thermal cameras now below $150, this type of exploit is becoming more common. To pull off this attack, a thermal image of a keyboard, or other input device, is captured within about 30 to 60 seconds after a user has typed in their login credentials. Areas of the input device that have been touched will be warmer than other areas, and the more recently they were touched, the warmer they are. That provides enough information to determine what was pressed and, more or less, in what order.",
                            ContentSummary = "Some practical safety tips also came out of the user studies. It was found, for example, that it was more difficult to recover passwords from touch typists than hunt-and-peck keyboard users, the latter group tending to leave their fingers on keys for longer. Keyboard material also mattered, with ABS plastics retaining heat considerably longer than PBT plastics. Longer passwords do help with security, to be sure, but thanks to tricks like thermal attacks, they may not be enough by themselves.",

This type of drinking, called binge drinking, is especially dangerous. Binge drinking is when you have five or more drinks within a few hours for men, and four or more for women. Examples of a standard drink size are a 12-ounce glass of beer, a 5-ounce glass of wine, or 1.5 ounces of hard liquor.Binge drinking can lead to blackouts or even deadly overdoses. Heavy drinking in general can cause many health problems. These include liver disease, heart and lung problems, and muscle and bone weakness.There has been some recent good news about drinking in the U.S. We’ve seen a steady decline in underage drinking, Koob says. And deaths associated with driving while intoxicated have, overall, gone down.We’ve also seen movements for things like ‘dry January,’ ‘sober curious,’ and bars serving non-alcoholic cocktails, Koob explains. People are more aware that there are individuals who don’t want to drink.But there’s also bad news. Over the last two decades, deaths involving alcohol use have more than doubled. The biggest increase has been for women.The COVID-19 pandemic may have made things worse.
